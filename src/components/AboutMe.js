                    <p>My full name is Emanuel Bravi, I was born on November 6, 1999, in the city of Corral de Bustos, province of Cordoba, Argentina, I was always active, I do not like to take a nap and I always have something to do in my free time, so I crossed this path of computer science, from home, taking free courses, awakening my interest and my desire to return to undertake and make this a job, today already in a university path I continue training and perhaps ahead of the academic self-taught in my spare time, I make the little things a passion and my roots made me a committed and responsible person, without further ado I hope you enjoy the passage through my Portfolio!</p>
